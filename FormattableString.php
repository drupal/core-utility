/**
 * Formats a string for HTML display by replacing variable placeholders.
 *
 * When cast to a string, this object replaces variable placeholders in the
 * string with the arguments passed in during construction and escapes the
 * values so they can be safely displayed as HTML. See the documentation of
 * \Drupal\Component\Utility\PlaceholderTrait::placeholderFormat() for
 * details on the supported placeholders and how to use them securely. Incorrect
 * use of this class can result in security vulnerabilities.
 *
 * In most cases, you should use TranslatableString or PluralTranslatableString
 * rather than this object, since they will translate the text (on
 * non-English-only sites) in addition to formatting it. Variables concatenated
 * without the insertion of language-specific words or punctuation are some
 * examples where translation is not applicable and using this class directly
 * directly is appropriate.
 *
 * This class is designed for formatting messages that are mostly text, not as
 * an HTML template language. As such, $string passed to the constructor should
 * contain minimal HTML.
 *
 * The result of casting this object to a string should not be used within the
 * "<" and ">" of an HTML tag, such as in HTML attribute values. This would be a
 * security risk.
 *
 * To build HTML that cannot meet these restrictions, use an HTML template
 * language such as Twig, rather than this class.
